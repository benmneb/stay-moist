Calling out around the world

Are you ready for a brand new beat?

Summer's here and the time is right

For dancing in the street

They're dancing in Chicago (Dancing in the street)

Down in New Orleans (Dancing in the street)

In New York City (Dancing in the street)

All we need is music, sweet music (Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet music)

There'll be music everywhere (Everywhere)

There'll be swinging, swaying

And records playing
